# Mockinizer Contributing Guidelines

some simple rules to make contributing as efficient as possible:

1. Before creating a Pull Request it is recommended to add an issue first that describes the improvement idea or bugfix.
This is a gread way to get feedback before starting to develop something.

1. When you create a Pull Request please add a link to the issue that you want to fix and include the issue number in the 
branch name of your fork. Example name: `issue/11`

1. Make sure all the unit tests passing. And adding new unit tests is a good idea.
